</pre>

## addon.info.json

<pre>
{
    "library": "ExampleUIXAddon",
    "i18n": {
        "ns": "example",
        "sources": {
            "en-US": "./locales/en-US.json",
            "zh-CN": "./locales/zh-CN.json"
        }
    },
    "css": [
        "./index.css"
    ]
}
</pre>

### "i18n" field
this field is used to config localization. "ns" specify namespace. "sources" specify files.

After configuration, we can use `[i18n-namespace]:[i18n-key]` to localize.

In this case, i18n namespace is "example", "i18n-key" could be "toolbar.title", "dialog.title" or "buttons.addText"(Refer to zh-CN.json for details). 

For example, 
> &lt;h6&gt;example:dialog.title&lt;/h6&gt;

will be translat to 
> &lt;h6&gt;Dialog title&lt;/h6&gt;

and 
> &lt;h6&gt;对话框标题&lt;/h6&gt;

### "css" field
Specify style sheets("index.css" is the output of style-loader).  Only css can work. 


## src/addonExample/index.js
Script entry for addon(Don't change it's filename). Please refer to source file for more details.

You can load them freely. In this demo, <i>path-objects</i> and <i>edit-graphics</i> are loaded. Please refer to `src/addons.js` to find out how to load them.

In other demos, predifiened addons is used individual. However, the can be merged into one file. Please refer to [addon-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@foxitsoftware/addon-loader) and
[gulp-merge-addon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@foxitsoftware/gulp-merge-addon)

## Structure of addons.
### addon entry
File `addon.info.json` is the entry of an addon. This file specifies addon's name, i18n files and css files.
### Script entry.
File `src/addonExample/index.js` shows how to register a dialog and how to bind event handler.

Generlly, an addon is a js class which contains 3 static methods:
``` javascript
static getName(){...} //Return addon's name.
static getLoader(){...} //Loader for addon.
static init(){...}  //Called after an addon is loaded. This would register some UI component.
```                             
and a member:
```javascript
fragments(){...} //Customize UI such as toolbar, side pannel.
```
